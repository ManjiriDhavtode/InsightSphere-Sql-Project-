InsightSphere: SQL Data Analysis Project
InsightSphere is a comprehensive SQL project designed to demonstrate data analysis skills through efficient querying and management of relational databases. This project simulates real-world scenarios involving multiple datasets across diverse domains like employee management, customer orders, healthcare, and product sales. The focus is on deriving meaningful insights and solving analytical challenges for data-driven decision-making.

📂 Database Structure
The project consists of five core relational tables:

Employees: Stores employee details, including their department and performance scores.
Departments: Contains department information linked to employees.
Customers: Holds customer profiles with their respective locations.
Orders: Tracks customer orders, associated products, and total amounts.
Products: Lists product details categorized into different categories.
Patients: Includes patient details along with the doctors treating them.
Doctors: Maintains doctor profiles, including specializations.
🛠️ Features and Queries
1. Data Exploration
Retrieve all data from each table for an initial understanding of datasets.
Use SHOW COLUMNS to inspect table structures.
2. Joins for Insights
Inner Join:
Find employees and their department names.
Match doctors with patients under their treatment.
Retrieve products ordered by customers, including order details.
Left Join:
List all employees along with their departments, even if they are unassigned.
Retrieve customers and their orders, including customers who haven't placed any orders.
Right Join:
Display departments with or without employees assigned.
3. Advanced Analytical Queries
Find the average performance score of employees grouped by departments.
Display the top 3 products with the highest total sales by calculating TotalAmount * Quantity.
Identify the second-highest performance score among employees.
List departments with no employees assigned.
4. Customer and Order Analysis
Count the total orders placed by each customer, including those who haven’t placed any orders.
Retrieve the customers who have placed more than one order.
Analyze revenue generated by product categories.
5. Healthcare Domain Analysis
Retrieve names of patients being treated by doctors specializing in specific fields like ‘Cardiology’ or ‘Oncology’.
List doctors and their patients using joins.
6. Performance-Based Filtering
Retrieve employees whose performance score exceeds a certain threshold and belong to a specific department.
